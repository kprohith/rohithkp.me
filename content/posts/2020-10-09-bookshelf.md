I have always enjoyed reading others' reading lists and browsing their bookshelves and recomendations, so this intended to be a digital version of that. I've only read about half of the books here and I intend to read all of them over time. (I guess I fall somewhere in the middle in the Umberto Eco theory of the library.)
