I've set up a sub-blog at <https://notionso.rkpblog.tech>, that's directly published from a public Notion Page in my Notion account.

There is no need to self-manage the site, or even git commit/pull everytime I make an update, as was the case with the previous implementation of a similar sub-blog at <https://notion.rkpblog.tech>

## Get Started

---

On a high level, we are utilizing [Cloudflare Workers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers/) to rewrite traffic. The solution is inspired by [this script](https://gist.github.com/mayneyao/b9fefc9625b76f70488e5d8c2a99315d) (thank you Mayne!), and I added my own features like pretty links.

- Step 0: Prerequisite

  1. Enable Public Access on your desired pages through Notion's Share menu, and Allow Search Engines.
  2. Purchase your desired domain with a registrar like Namecheap, or use your existing domain or subdomain.

- Step 1: Set up your Cloudflare account (5 mins)

  1. Sign up for an account: [https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)

     ![](https://fruitionsite.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F5c7779fb-47cf-4cb7-813a-83b9d8bf9b35%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=f0d94463-cf43-42f7-a61d-0784b8af1e7f&width=5570&cache=v2)

  2. Enter your custom domain name. If you would like to use a subdomain, you should still entire your root domain name here.

     ![](https://fruitionsite.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fed1a3c23-a9ec-4d11-9391-a75cb56c3975%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=d5ff74b3-5375-4732-8464-e712a1096487&width=5570&cache=v2)

  3. Select the Free plan

     ![](https://fruitionsite.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F7e547892-a740-421d-95d4-121230a3bbd0%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=e6ecebc7-bce8-4f3c-968b-fb3b41814060&width=5570&cache=v2)

  4. If you don't have any A records imported, add one with your root domain as the Name and `1.1.1.1` as the Content. Otherwise, click Continue on the DNS Record page.

     - If you are using a subdomain and don't have any CNAME records imported, add one with your subdomain as the Name and `1.1.1.1` as the Content.

     ![](https://fruitionsite.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9e36279b-9c8b-4c9b-bfeb-44b98d91437f%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=ed7b571e-25ec-4f66-a683-1ec6cdeace85&width=5570&cache=v2)

  5. Copy the 2 nameservers, which end with `.ns.cloudflare.com`

     ![](https://fruitionsite.com/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe93d1654-3278-4d62-987c-227022f5454b%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=e5853c2d-e226-4e2c-b660-59a0e6fef2fd&width=5570&cache=v2)

  6. Paste the nameservers in the domain setting page at your registrar (Namecheap in my case). Make sure you save the setting.

  7. Wait for a minute, then click Done, check nameservers

  9. Turn on Always Use HTTPS, Auto Minify, and Brotli (all 3 optional but recommended)

  11. You should see this screen. If Cloudflare hasn't detected your site, click Re-check your site, and refresh the page.
