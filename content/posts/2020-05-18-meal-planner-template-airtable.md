- **Grocery Items:** List of grocery items.
- **Recipes:** List of recipes.
- **Ingredients:** Links recipes to grocery items with quantities needed.
- **Meal Plan:** Links days and meal times to recipes.

- Recipe Kanban view for collection and inspiration.
- Inventory view to assess shopping needs.
- Shopping list view to identify needs at grocery store.
