I recently found [this](https://awesomeblog.club/) website on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
It is a public repository of personal blogs, mostly tech blogs.  
It's called [Awesomeblog.club](https://Awesomeblog.club).

> [awesomeblog.club](https://awesomeblog.club/)

I listed [my blog](/) on there as well.

Do check it out as there are quite a few interesting blogs listed there.
