 A text-based version of the [popular two player game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

 Size of the game is _dynamically_ set depending on the user's choice.

 This game is entirely written in [python](https://python.org).

 This script uses [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) for adding color to the commandline output.

 Install colorama to see colored output.

```python
# @author = RKP
# python version = 3.7
import itertools
from colorama import Fore, Back, Style, init
